- [x] Fixed progression visibility gaps: progression counters now persist every cycle (not every 10 cycles), progression logs API now falls back to structured logs when normal logs are empty
- [x] Rebuilt detailed logs aggregation to combine all active/base connection logs and metrics (instead of single focus-only view)
- [x] Improved functional overview metrics by reading `trade_engine_state` from settings namespace and falling back to progression-state counters

- [x] Fixed process migration guard persistence by syncing `setMigrationsRun()`/`haveMigrationsRun()` with `globalThis.__migrations_run`
- [x] Added duplicate-loop protection for periodic connection testing so repeated startup/health calls do not spawn multiple intervals
- [x] Optimized Redis-heavy workflow reads: parallelized connection/trade/position fetches and added short TTL + in-flight dedupe cache for dashboard workflow snapshots
- [x] Improved logistics queue payload to avoid hardcoded symbol placeholders; now derives focus symbol from real progression log details when available
- [x] Cleaned migration set-initialization logic to stop inserting empty-string placeholder members into Redis sets
- [x] Marked long-running background timers (`redis` TTL cleanup, progression-log flush, periodic connection testing) as non-blocking via `unref()` to prevent script/test hang loops

- [x] Verified full quality gate (`bun lint`, `bun typecheck`, `bun run build`) now passes after stabilization changes
- [x] Fixed BingX credential persistence path: removed legacy duplicate base/default-disabled seed behavior and enforced canonical base IDs (`bingx-x01` etc.) with credential injection from env
- [x] Added env credential resolver (`lib/env-credentials.ts`) with alias + quote/whitespace normalization so provided BingX secrets are reliably loaded
- [x] Updated startup/system credential injection endpoints and migration hooks to use normalized env reads, preventing blank BingX creation when alternate env naming is used
- [x] Reworked startup/base seeding to canonical IDs only (`bybit-x03`, `bingx-x01`, `pionex-x01`, `orangex-x01`) and removed legacy IDs (`*-base`, `*-default-disabled`) that caused duplicate/blank BingX entries
- [x] Added defensive credential-preservation in connection PUT/PATCH routes so empty form payloads no longer wipe stored API keys/secrets
- [x] Normalized available-connections filtering to canonical base IDs and fixed credential checks to require both key+secret lengths
- [x] Added dotenv fallback parsing in env credential resolver (`.env.local`/`.env`) to load provided credentials even when process env is not preloaded
- [x] Switched canonical base-connection provisioning to predefined in-code credentials (no env-var dependency) across migrations, default seeding, init-status auto-injection, and system credential/fix endpoints
- [x] Completed connection-system conformity hardening pass: normalized boolean input/flag handling across toggle APIs, removed SQL/Redis split in critical connection mutation routes, fixed batch-test limiter window semantics, ensured credential injection also maintains `connections` set membership, and corrected coordinator credential/state gating + health refresh behavior
- [x] Repaired dashboard monitoring/info/state stability: normalized Smart Overview and Monitoring payload handling, fixed symbols stats contract mismatch (`openPositions` vs `livePositions`), added DB size estimation in monitoring API, and improved Symbols Overview responsive layout for mobile/tablet density
- [x] Fixed build failure: installed missing deps (@radix-ui, tailwindcss, sonner, bcryptjs, etc.), added @tailwindcss/postcss for Tailwind 4, fixed @next/swc version mismatch by installing correct SWC versions (15.5.7)
- [x] Fixed indication progression failure accounting in `TradeEngineManager`: failed cycles are now counted on every processor error (instead of conditional modulo behavior), and error progression events now include attempted/success/error counters for better observability
- [x] Fixed progression running-state detection in `/api/connections/progression/[id]` to require current runtime evidence (running flag/state/recent activity) instead of historical cycle totals, preventing stale "running" status after engines stop
- [x] Fixed system integrity verification workflow for mixed persistence modes: `scripts/verify-system-integrity.js` now recognizes Redis-first runtime as valid (without requiring `data/trading.db`) and avoids legacy sqlite-only failure behavior
- [x] Optimized Redis connection data access by introducing per-connection index sets for trades/positions (`trades:by-connection:*`, `positions:by-connection:*`) with backward-compatible fallback hydration and stale-index cleanup
- [x] Improved logistics/workflow metrics coherence by exposing engine cycle+duration stats in `dashboard-workflow` and using measured engine latencies/rates in `/api/logistics/queue` instead of synthetic values
- [x] Removed repeated base-seeding trigger from connections GET API to stop unintended re-creation/reappearance flows during normal polling
- [x] Hardened base seeder with persisted one-time marker and adjusted startup defaults so only Bybit/BingX are pre-assigned to Main; Pionex/OrangeX remain base-enabled but unassigned
- [x] Fixed connection state mutation edge-cases: prevented dashboard-enable from implicitly inserting unassigned connections, normalized `add-to-active` duplicate checks with truthy flag parser, and stopped `init-status`/credential inject helpers from forcing `is_active_inserted=1`
- [x] Aligned Smart/System overview active counts and cycle stats to workflow snapshot metrics for consistent connection state display across sections
- [x] Re-normalized indication set retention behavior to configurable per-type limits (default 250) and removed hardcoded 100-entry truncation in batch/single save paths to keep preprocessing datasets complete for independent config evaluations
- [x] Expanded indication-set independence for Active/Optimal processing: Active now evaluates multidimensional config combinations (threshold/drawdown ratio/active-time ratio/last-part ratio/factor multiplier) with per-config set keys, and Optimal now evaluates full 3-30 ranges with factor variants
- [x] Added strategy per-configuration persistence for MAIN stage (`strategies:{connection}:{symbol}:main:cfg:{configKey}`) so each position-size/leverage/state combination has its own independent set for stats/logistics diagnostics
- [x] Extended Direction/Move indication independence to full 3-30 range configs with ratio/factor variants (drawdown + last-part + multiplier) and per-combination set keys, while preserving high-frequency performance via capped batch writes
- [x] Updated Direction/Move/Active config processing to evaluate and persist the full generated combination sets each cycle (removed per-cycle 250-write slicing and timeout-gated skipping for Direction/Move) to ensure complete per-config coverage
- [x] Optimized high-frequency indication persistence by converting per-config batch writes to bounded parallel chunk processing (concurrency-limited) while preserving per-set retention limits
- [x] Added settings-driven indication grid controls (range start/end/step + ratio/factor arrays) so Direction/Move/Active/Optimal config spaces are tunable without code changes while retaining independent per-config persistence
- [x] Fixed indication stats/entries retrieval for new per-config key model by aggregating across all matching config-set keys (`indication_set:{connection}:{symbol}:{type}*`) instead of legacy single-key lookups

| 2026-03-26 | Resolved runtime 500 path by disabling pre-startup instrumentation import chain, simplified `app/page.tsx` to server redirect (`/live-trading`), restored per-second DB limit default+settings wiring, and fixed duplicate import/export regressions in live/strategies/indications/presets and indications-settings pages so key routes return 200/307 in dev checks. |
| 2026-03-26 | Fixed production deploy 500 by removing duplicate `export const dynamic` declarations introduced across multiple app pages (chat-history, volume-corrections, admin pages, alerts, portfolios, sets, analysis, etc.); production build now succeeds and `bun run start` returns 200 on `/` and `/settings`. |
| 2026-03-26 | Restored original independent dashboard main page routing by removing `app/page.tsx` override so `/` resolves to `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` again; verified `/`, `/live-trading`, and `/settings` all return 200 with dashboard layout and sidebar intact. |
| 2026-03-16 | Verified build, typecheck, lint pass; committed tsconfig.json mandatory updates |
| Initial | Template created with base setup |
